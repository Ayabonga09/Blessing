  I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. The years are flying and I’m running out of new things to say each time but what never changes is how much love I have for you.  
  <br /><br />
  May your day be filled with blessings, joy, and laughter. I pray God keeps you safe, grants you many more years full of dreams coming true, and surrounds you with peace and success.  
  <br /><br />
  Please never lose that kind, beautiful heart U have but always remember to put yourself first.   
  <br /><br />
  Growing up really sucks sometimes, I miss u so much but I truly hope u’ve got amazing people around u who love u just like I do.
